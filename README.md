# PerLisp [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/memowe/perlisp.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/memowe/perlisp)

This is a simple statically scoped Lisp interpreter, written in Perl. During the
lecture "Structure and Interpretation of Programming Languages", held by Achim
Clausing (WWU MÃ¼nster, Germany), I needed to try out different things, so I
wrote this.

**DISCLAIMER** This is **not** production ready. I use it to play around and I
think there are many bugs lurking around. You have been warned! :-)

How to start?
-------------

Install PerLisp like a normal Perl distro:

    $ perl Makefile.PL
    $ make
    $ make test
    $ make install
    $ make clean

Now you can call the perlisp script which starts a read eval print loop (see
more details below):

    $ perlisp

If you want to hack PerLisp, view the API docs via

    $ perldoc PerLisp

If you don't want to install all that stuff, you can call the `perlisp` script
from the project root directory:

    $ cd ~/code/perlisp
    $ perl perlisp

And it should just work. Now let's do some Lisp stuff!

PerLisp uses the `bind` operator to bind values to names, you have a `lambda`
operator to create function values and the convenience operator `define` to bind
a function to a name in one step. With the `bound` operator you get a list of
all bound names. Most of them come from the `init.perlisp` file, which is loaded
while the interpreter starts.

Start typing something like this:

> `(+ 17 25)`  
> **42**  
> `(define (square x) (* x x))`  
> **Function: (x) -> (* x x)**  
> `(square 42)`  
> **1764**

You can find more inspirations from `PerLisp::Init` and the tests, especially
`t/50-init.t`, which shows some use cases for the init functions.

### Some interesting stuff

* Like Haskell, PerLisp fully supports **autocurryfication**, which means a
function applied to too less arguments will return a function with parameters
for the remaining arguments automagically. It's super-easy to define useful
functions using autocurryfication in combination with some well known higher
order functions:

> `(bind product (reduce * 1))`  
> **Function: (l) -> (cond (nil? l) 1 (* (car l) (reduce * 1 (cdr l))))**  
> `(product (list 2 7 3))`  
> **42**

* PerLisp is able to interpret a simple Lisp interpreter written in Lisp which
is able to run itself inside PerLisp. Amazing! And there's a test for it in
`t/61-lisplisp.t`. However, to calculate even a simple expression in a
three-level nested interpreter chain takes some time so you have to enable the
test explicitly by setting the `LISPLISP` environment variable to a true value.

Interpreter details
-------------------

The implementation is straight forward. PerLisp uses objects from the following
classes to get you started with Lisp:

* `PerLisp::Lexer` - generates a `PerLisp::TokenStream` from Lisp strings
* `PerLisp::Parser` - generates `PerLixp::Expr::*` objects from a TokenStream
* `PerLisp::Expr::*` - Lisp expressions
* `PerLisp::Context` - objects which store value-name bindings
* `PerLisp::Operators` - perl implementations of built-in operators
* `PerLisp::Init` - a container package around the init script

View the code for more implementation details, I tried hard to make it very
readable (even if you don't know much Perl).
